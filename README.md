## Introduction
Ethiopia has the two biggest religious festivals that are celebrated once a year. These are Meskel and Timkate. The former is on the 26th of September, the latter on the 18th and 19th of January. Meskel can be called "The Finding of the True Cross" whereas Timkate is "Ethiopian Epiphany".
