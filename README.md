## Introduction
Ethiopia has the two biggest religious festivals that are celebrated once a year. These are Meskel and Timkate. The former is on the 26th of September, the latter on the 18th and 19th of January. Meskel can be called "The Finding of the True Cross" whereas Timkate is "Ethiopian Epiphany".

## overview
A religious festival website is a good place to start looking for information about events. It will tell you about when and where they are interesting festivals. It will also generally allow taking a virtual tour of festivals.
The site targets people looking for exciting religious festival destinations, where they enjoy, have memorable moments and lift experiences.

I fix some of them like the apple icon touch just by inserting the link attribute in the heading element.The remainings are large layout around logo, landing image description.
